# Destroyer-Cache
The Destroyer class is an in-memory caching solution designed to store key-value pairs with support for automatic expiration and basic arithmetic operations. Each instance of Destroyer maintains a cache object and uses a min-heap priority queue for efficiently managing expirations, allowing for rapid cleanup of expired items.
